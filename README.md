### What I learned

This was my first full-stack application as a front end developer. I have to say the full-stack world is fascinating. This project definitely took me out of my comfort zone. I learnt how to work with data and databases. I also learn how to create Api's that connected my database to my front end application. It was quite fun.

### Continued development

I plan to add a drag and drop functionality on the roadmap page, I have made a branch for that feature, it's quite a challenge but I think I would be able to implement it.
