# Product feedback rewrite

I want rewrite that uses serverless functions on AWS & Dynamo DB as the database layer on the backend. Probably play around with Docker and Terraform for deployments & some CI & CD with Github Actions. Would probably be easier to rewrite it with Next.js & Typescript with Next.js serverless functions, but where's the fun in that?. Would also want some redis action in there, idk.

The whole application would be managed in a mono repo with Turbo Repo.

## Backend

- [x] Nest JS
- [x] AWS services: Lambda, S3, Dynamo DB
- [x] Serverless Framework

- [x] **GraphQL
- [x] Github Actions
- [x] Test's for the backend ?

## Frontend

- [x] ~~Static Front end using Astro~~
- [x] App with Next Js & Typescript
- [x] Authentication with Next Auth
- [x] Forms: React hook Form
- [x] Styling: Stitches

- [x] Relay or Apollo as a GQL client ?
